  "Coverage for `kotoba.geo.noise`, the procedural value-noise/fBm used to
  fake globe relief when no DEM is supplied. Ported from kami-geo's
  `mesh.rs` (`fbm2`/`ridged_fbm2`/`value_noise2`/`hash2`) — no
  `#[cfg(test)]` fixture was recovered, so these check determinism,
  boundedness, and the smoothstep/lerp building blocks the noise depends
  on, plus the octaves=1 identities that let fbm2/ridged-fbm2 degenerate
  to value-noise2."
